While I started off coding in various other languages for the past 9 years I have been working with **Ruby** and am loving it ‚ù§Ô∏è

More recently, since [Hacktoberfest '22](https://hacktoberfest.com/) and reading [How To Open source](https://howtoopensource.dev/) by [Richard Schneeman](https://schneems.com/about) I have been inspired to contribute more back to the community and so lately I have been focusing on open source.

I have thus released a number of gems all extracted from projects I have worked on, are used in production in apps I support today (so at least I'm finding them useful!) 

I have also had PRs merged for:
- a bug fix on [ruby/ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/6568), 
- Improved spec coverage of [ruby/spec](https://github.com/ruby/spec/pull/958)
- A small bug fix on [rails/rails](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/47014). 
- Small contributions but I hope to do more soon! 

Various other contributions include:
- A bug fix in Crystal (#9577 on [crystal-lang/crystal](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/9577))
- Various improvements to Natalie eg [this on natalie-lang/natalie](https://github.com/natalie-lang/natalie/pull/679)
- Docs on [rails/propshaft](https://github.com/rails/propshaft/pull/81)
- A small improvement to [rails/jsbundling-rails](https://github.com/rails/jsbundling-rails/pull/99)
